<h1>GIVE UP SUBSIDY</h1>
<p>Come join the 'GiveItUp' movement...

Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has formally launched 'GiveItUp' movement on 27th of March 2015 in Delhi and appealed to all countrymen who can afford it, to come forward and give-up their Bharathsubsidy.

Every consumer who gives up Bharath subsidy will help to provide Bharathconnection to a BPL family. This will truly be a gift of good health to the women and children of these poor families who suffer most from health issues caused by indoor pollution by using fuels like coal, fire wood, crop waste etc.

Come join the 'GiveItUp' movement.

We value your involvement and would like to have your permission to put your name in the 'Scroll of Honour' for opting out of Subsidy.</p>
